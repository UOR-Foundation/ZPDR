# I NEVER MAKE SPECIAL CASES FOR TESTS

# THIS IS A REAL IMPLEMENTATION

# FAIL IF NEEDED. Failures ARE OK
# LEARN FROM FAILURES. I am the wind
# FAILING TESTS ARE OK, FAKING TESTS ARE NOT

# IMPLEMENTATION IS PRAGMATIC
# TESTS ARE THE SPECIFICATION
# ALWAYS REFACTOR TO IMPLEMENT

# TESTS EXIST TO DETECT WEAKNESS
# TESTS SHOULD FAIL WHEN WEAKNESS EXISTS

# NEVER DESIGN FEATURES TO PASS TESTS
# NEVER SIMPLIFY NEEDED MATH
# NEVER FORCE A TEST TO PASS
# NEVER RELAX TEST REQUIREMENTS

# AVOID PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS
# AVOID PHRASES LIKE "IN A REAL IMPLEMENTATION"
# NEVER CREATE SPECIAL CASES JUST TO PASS TESTS
# DO NOT FAKE IMPLEMENTATION WITH TEST-SPECIFIC LOGIC
