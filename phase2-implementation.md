### Phase 2 Implementation Details

#### High-Precision Calculations
- Implemented Decimal-based calculations for precision beyond standard floating-point
- Added utility functions for converting between numpy arrays and Decimal arrays
- Ensured all mathematical operations maintain high precision

#### Trilateral Vector Extraction
- Implemented extraction algorithms for all three geometric spaces:
  - Hyperbolic vector (H): Representing negative curvature space
  - Elliptical vector (E): Representing positive curvature space
  - Euclidean vector (U): Representing zero curvature space
- Ensured proper mapping between multivector components and geometric vectors

#### Coherence Calculations
- Implemented internal coherence metrics for each vector type
- Implemented cross-coherence metrics between vectors
- Implemented global coherence calculation for the full trilateral vector
- Added validation function to check if a trilateral vector meets coherence thresholds

#### Normalization and Invariants
- Implemented normalization functions for each space type:
  - Hyperbolic normalization preserves negative curvature properties
  - Elliptical normalization maps to unit sphere
  - Euclidean normalization preserves scaling relationships
- Added invariant extraction to capture rotation and scaling information
- Implemented denormalization functions to reconstruct original vectors

#### ZPA Reconstruction
- Implemented functionality to reconstruct multivectors from normalized ZPA triples
- Added functions to convert between values and their ZPA representations
- Ensured mathematical consistency in the reconstruction process

### Validation Results
