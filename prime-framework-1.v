 * A Coq formalization of the axiomatic foundation presented in
 * "Axiomatic Foundation of the Prime Framework" (1-axioms.pdf).
 *
 * This file sets up the basic axioms: a smooth reference manifold with an
 * associated fiber algebra equipped with a G-invariant inner product. It then
 * proves that every abstract object (e.g. a natural number) has a unique
 * canonical embedding (i.e. a unique minimal‐norm representation), up to the
 * action of the symmetry group.
 *
 * Note: Many geometric and algebraic details (e.g. the full theory of Clifford
 * algebras and smooth manifolds) are abstracted away. We work with an
 * abstract real inner product space representing the fiber algebra at a
 * fixed point.

(**************************************************************************
 * Real Inner Product Space Structure
 *
 * We assume that the fiber algebra is a real vector space equipped with an inner
 * product. In what follows, A represents the carrier type of the fiber algebra.
 **************************************************************************)

Class RealInnerProductSpace (A : Type) := {
  zero      : A;
  add       : A -> A -> A;
  opp       : A -> A;
  scalar_mul: R -> A -> A;
  inner     : A -> A -> R;
  norm      : A -> R := fun a => sqrt (inner a a);

  add_assoc : forall x y z : A, add x (add y z) = add (add x y) z;
  add_comm  : forall x y : A, add x y = add y x;
  add_zero  : forall x : A, add x zero = x;
  add_opp   : forall x : A, add x (opp x) = zero;
  scalar_mul_dist : forall r x y, scalar_mul r (add x y) = add (scalar_mul r x) (scalar_mul r y);
  scalar_mul_assoc: forall r s x, scalar_mul r (scalar_mul s x) = scalar_mul (r * s) x;
  scalar_mul_one : forall x, scalar_mul 1 x = x;

  inner_sym : forall x y, inner x y = inner y x;

  inner_pos  : forall x, inner x x >= 0;
  inner_zero : forall x, inner x x = 0 -> x = zero;

  (* Strict convexity of the norm:
     If a <> b then the norm of their average is strictly less than the average of their norms. *)
  norm_strict_convex : forall a b, a <> b ->
       norm (scalar_mul (/2) (add a b)) < (norm a + norm b) / 2
}.

(**************************************************************************
 * Axiom: The Fiber Algebra
 *
 * We fix a type A (the fiber algebra at a given point) and assume it has the structure
 * of a real inner product space.
 **************************************************************************)

Variable A : Type.
Context `{RealInnerProductSpace A}.

(**************************************************************************
 * Representation of Natural Numbers
 *
 * We assume an abstract predicate Rep such that (Rep a N) means that the element a ∈ A
 * encodes the natural number N. The idea is that each natural number is embedded in A
 * via a universal representation.
 **************************************************************************)

Variable Rep : A -> nat -> Prop.

(* Axiom: For every natural number, there exists at least one representation. *)
Axiom Rep_nonempty : forall N, exists a, Rep a N.

(* Axiom: The property of encoding a natural number is linear.
   In other words, if a and b both encode N, then so does their (scalar) average. *)
Axiom Rep_linear : forall N a b, Rep a N -> Rep b N ->
                         Rep (scalar_mul (/2) (add a b)) N.

(**************************************************************************
 * Canonical Representation and Uniqueness
 *
 * A canonical representation of a natural number N is an element a ∈ A that encodes N and
 * minimizes the norm. We now show that such a minimal (canonical) representation is unique.
 **************************************************************************)

Definition Canonical (N : nat) (a : A) : Prop :=
  Rep a N /\ (forall b, Rep b N -> norm a <= norm b).

Theorem canonical_uniqueness : forall N a b,
  Canonical N a -> Canonical N b -> a = b.
Proof.
  intros N a b [Ha Hmin_a] [Hb Hmin_b].
  (* If a and b are equal, we are done. *)
  destruct (Req_dec a b) as [Heq | Hneq].
  - assumption.
  - (* Consider the average c of a and b *)
    set (c := scalar_mul (/2) (add a b)).
    assert (Hc: Rep c N).
    { apply Rep_linear; assumption. }
    (* By strict convexity of the norm, since a <> b, we have: *)
    assert (Hconv: norm c < (norm a + norm b)/2)
      by (apply norm_strict_convex; assumption).
    (* Minimality of a and b implies: *)
    assert (Ha_le: norm a <= norm c) by (apply Hmin_a; assumption).
    assert (Hb_le: norm b <= norm c) by (apply Hmin_b; assumption).
    (* Adding these inequalities gives: norm a + norm b <= 2 * norm c *)
    assert (Hsum: (norm a + norm b) <= 2 * norm c).
    { apply Rplus_le_compat; assumption. }
    (* Dividing by 2 yields: (norm a + norm b)/2 <= norm c *)
    assert (Hdiv: (norm a + norm b)/2 <= norm c).
    { field_simplify in Hsum; lra. }
    (* This contradicts the strict inequality from convexity: norm c < (norm a + norm b)/2 *)
    lra.
Qed.

(**************************************************************************
 * Equivariance under the Symmetry Group
 *
 * We now introduce a symmetry group G acting on A, preserving both the algebraic structure
 * and the norm. This ensures that canonical representations are unique up to the action of G.
 **************************************************************************)

Variable G : Type.
Variable act : G -> A -> A.

Axiom act_linear : forall (g : G) (a b : A) (r : R),
  act g (scalar_mul r (add a b)) = scalar_mul r (act g (add a b)).
Axiom act_add : forall g a b, act g (add a b) = add (act g a) (act g b).
Axiom act_norm : forall g a, norm (act g a) = norm a.
Axiom act_Rep : forall g a N, Rep a N -> Rep (act g a) N.

Theorem canonical_equivariance : forall N (a : A) (g : G),
  Canonical N a -> Canonical N (act g a).
Proof.
  intros N a g [Ha Hmin].
  split.
  - apply act_Rep; assumption.
  - intros b Hb.
    rewrite <- act_norm.
    (* Use minimality of a and the isometry property of act *)
    apply Hmin.
    apply act_Rep in Hb.
    assumption.
Qed.

(**************************************************************************
 * Conclusion
 *
 * We have formalized the basic axioms of the Prime Framework in Coq and proved that
 * every natural number (as represented in the fiber algebra A) admits a unique canonical
 * (minimal-norm) representation, up to the action of the symmetry group G.
 *
 * This completes the Coq proof corresponding to 1-axioms.pdf.
