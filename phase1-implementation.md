## Core Components Implemented

### Multivector Class (`core/multivector.py`)
- Implements a Clifford algebra multivector as a dictionary mapping basis elements to their coefficients
- Supports operations including addition, geometric product, inner product, outer product
- Provides grade-specific extraction (scalar, vector, bivector, trivector parts)
- Implements norm calculations and other multivector utilities

### Geometric Spaces (`core/geometric_spaces.py`)
- Implements three geometric spaces:
  - **HyperbolicVector**: Negative curvature space using the Poincar√© disk model
  - **EllipticalVector**: Positive curvature space using a spherical model
  - **EuclideanVector**: Flat space using standard Euclidean geometry
- Each space implements appropriate operations (addition, inner product, distance)
- Vectors are automatically normalized/projected to ensure they're valid in their space

### Space Transformations (`core/geometric_spaces.py`)
- Implements the `SpaceTransformer` class with methods to convert between:
  - Hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces
  - Elliptical and Euclidean spaces
  - Hyperbolic and Elliptical spaces (via Euclidean intermediate)
- Ensures all transformations maintain appropriate geometric properties

### Testing and Examples
- Basic unit tests for all components implemented in `tests/test_basic.py`
- Simple example demonstrating usage in `examples/basic_example.py`

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
The next phase will focus on:
- Implementing multivector data encoding
- Building ZPA extraction algorithms
- Creating basic coherence calculations
- Developing a simple serialization format
