2. ✅ Basic ZPDR Operations (Phase 2)
3. ⬜ Full Pipeline (Phase 3)
   - ⬜ Complete Encoding/Decoding Pipeline
   - ⬜ Verification Mechanisms
   - ⬜ Error Correction
   - ⬜ Performance Optimization

## Phase 3 Implementation Goals

### 1. Complete Encoding/Decoding Pipeline

Phase 3 requires a seamless pipeline that can:
- Convert raw data (numbers, strings, etc.) to multivector representation
- Extract the trilateral vector components (H, E, U)
- Normalize to zero-point orientation
- Compute coherence measures
- Generate a manifest with all necessary metadata
- Parse ZPA manifests
- Derive base transformations and span metrics
- Reconstruct the original data from ZPA with no information loss

### 2. Verification Mechanisms

Implements robust verification that:
- Validates ZPA integrity before any operation
- Ensures coherence meets required thresholds
- Verifies that invariants are mathematically consistent
- Detects tampering or corruption in ZPA manifests
- Confirms successful reconstruction from ZPA

### 3. Error Correction

Adds error correction capabilities that:
- Detect noise and errors in ZPA components
- Correct errors using redundant encoding and normalization
- Improve resilience against progressive error accumulation
- Recover from partial corruption in ZPA components
- Maintain mathematical validity during error correction

### 4. Performance Optimization

Optimizes the ZPDR system for:
- Efficient encoding and decoding operations
- Fast serialization and deserialization of manifests
- Minimal memory usage during processing
- Support for batch processing of multiple values
- Optional multithreaded processing for improved throughput
